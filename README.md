# TurtleDrawingProjectStarter

## Introduction
Welcome to the Turtle Drawing Project Starter! This project allows you to create fun drawings by controlling a turtle that moves around the screen. You can make the turtle draw shapes, lines, or anything you can imagine.

## How to Use This Project

### Step 1: Open the Project
1. Open the project in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Locate the file named `Tester.java`.

### Step 2: Add Code to Move the Turtle
1. Open the `Tester.java` file.
2. Inside the file, you will see a section where you can add code to control the turtle.
3. Use simple commands to move the turtle and make it draw. For example:
   - Move the turtle forward.
   - Turn the turtle to the left or right.
   - Change the turtle's pen color.

### Example Code
Here’s an example of what you can add to `Tester.java`:
```java
turtle.forward(100); // Move the turtle forward by 100 units
turtle.turnRight(90); // Turn the turtle 90 degrees to the right
turtle.forward(50); // Move the turtle forward by 50 units
